The software developed is capable of control the following mining software.

## optiminer


## sgminer

# Repository structure
The repository contains the following folders:

- __Arduino__, code and schema for the sensor board (Arduino based)
- __DataAnalysis__, code and data for the analysis and formal model construction,
- __MonitoringServer__, db and scripts used for get information and send command to GPU and mimer software.

# Example
TBD
